### 1. Capitalize on Higher-Priced Items and Key Product Categories
- **Insight**: Higher-priced items (MRP) and certain product categories, like Starchy Foods, Seafood, and Fruits & Vegetables, are driving the highest sales.
  
- **Action**: Increase the promotion of these higher-MRP products across all stores, especially in top-performing categories. Implement targeted marketing campaigns around these items to further boost revenue. Consider bundling high-performing products with lower-selling items to increase overall basket size.

### 2. Promote Low-Fat and Healthier Product Options
- **Insight**: Low-fat products are contributing significantly to sales, reflecting a growing customer preference for healthier options.
  
- **Action**: Expand the promotion of low-fat and health-conscious products, especially in stores where sales are lagging. Ensure these products are prominently displayed and part of any health-focused marketing campaigns. Consider introducing exclusive healthy product lines to capitalize on this trend.

### 4. Invest in Tier 2 (Suburban) Locations
- **Insight**: Tier 2 (suburban) stores are outperforming Tier 1 (urban) and Tier 3 (rural) locations in terms of sales.
  
- **Action**: Invest more resources into Tier 2 suburban stores, where customer engagement is higher. Tailor promotions and stock assortments to the needs of suburban customers, who may have different shopping preferences than urban or rural shoppers. Further enhance the in-store experience in these high-potential locations to maximize revenue.
