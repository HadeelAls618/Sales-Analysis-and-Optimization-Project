# **Sales Analysis and Optimization Project**

### **Overview**
This project focuses on the analysis and optimization of sales across multiple retail stores. Using data-driven techniques, we identified key factors that impact sales performance, developed actionable insights, and provided solutions to enhance sales and improve store performance. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning model building, and actionable insights based on data analysis.

### **Data-Driven Insights and Solutions**
You can find the detailed insights and data-driven solutions [here](documents/Data_driven_solution/Insights.md).
