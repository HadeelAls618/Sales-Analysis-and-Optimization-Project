# **Sales Analysis and Optimization Project**

### **Overview**
This project focuses on the analysis and optimization of sales across multiple retail stores. Using data-driven techniques, we identified key factors that impact sales performance, developed actionable insights, and provided solutions to enhance sales and improve store performance. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning model building, and actionable insights based on data analysis.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Prepare raw sales data for analysis by handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring high data quality.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Dive deep into the data to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships that impact sales performance.

- **Machine Learning Models**: Train models to predict sales performance based on historical data, allowing for more informed decision-making.

- **Actionable Insights**: Convert raw data into strategic business recommendations that empower stakeholders to make informed decisions and drive store performance optimization.  [here](documents/Data_driven_solution/Insights.md).

- **Sales Dashboard**: Visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends in an easy-to-understand dashboard format.

The dashboard below visualizes key insights derived from the analysis.
